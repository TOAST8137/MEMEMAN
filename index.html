<h2> About Meme Man </h2>

<div id="Fist">

<p>Meme Man is known mainly for his appearance in the meme stonks,
a deliberate mispelling of stocks. It is used to describe some sort 
of financial exchange or trade. This originated with an attempt at 
animating a 3D human head that obviously resulted quite poorly. 
The poorly animated head, dubbed "Meme Man" colloqially, has been 
used in several other memes largely centred around deliberately mispelled 
words or broken english. Famous examples including "I taste a vegetal" and 
"I have acheived komdy", or more recently "panik, kalm, panikk" </p>

<p> Meme Man was originally created as a facebook page's mascot, but blew up into a meme because of how badly drawn he was. But next time you buy something, think to yourself "Am i acheiving full stonks?"</p>
